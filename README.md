# rpg-kotlin
A simple rpg in order to learn kotlin and few other techs

The display code was originally based on https://github.com/trystan/AsciiPanel

The game code was based on https://trystans.blogspot.com.es/2011/08/roguelike-tutorial-01-java-eclipse.html

But both have been heavily reworked

Stomp.js is from https://github.com/apache/activemq/tree/master/activemq-web-demo


**Note: This is play code not professional. So there is minimal documentation and no tests**
